## Overview

A voting web app made for everyone to use! While voting can be done through online forms and surveys on platforms like SurveyMonkey, these forms can be complicated to navigate and generating them can be time-consuming and clunky. Votester aims to solve this problem by providing users with a simple, inuitive and scalable web app that any party can use to create a vote. From deciding where to eat of holding a virtual town hall vote, the app is designed to be used by everyone! 

### Creating a Poll
To get started, all you need is a sharable poll name and password! When you click on `Confirm Info`, a unique website is generated using request parameters.
